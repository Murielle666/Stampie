Stampie is a small library that makes it easy to send emails through online services. It does this by
implementing specific handlers for each of them.

Supported services are currently:

 * [Mandrill](https://www.mandrill.com/)
 * [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/)

You can read more about the library in [it's documentation](http://stampie.readthedocs.org).

Warning
-------

This branch aims to fix some of the messy stuff that have happended over time in the stable releases.
Together with integrating most of the features from StampieExtra. This makes it more feature complete
and enjoyable to work with.

This branch contains the next iteration of Stampie. This means all the features currently in the
stable version are not yet migrated over. Also this means the code here is extremely conceptional
and may not work as intended.
